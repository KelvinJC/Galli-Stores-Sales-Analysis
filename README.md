# Galli Stores Sales Analysis

## A report of the descriptive analysis performed on sales data of Galli Stores. The data spanned the course of a 12 period.
<br>

Galli Stores is a retail chain operating in several cities across the US. They require a sales analysis of their figures covering a the past year. The management wants to know the answers to questions such as:
1. What was the best month for sales? 
2. How much was earned that month?
3. What city had the highest number of sales?
4. What time should we display advertising to maximise likelihood of customers buying product?
5. What products are most often sold together?
6. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

 Taking on the role of a Data Analyst, I analysed the data to provide these answers.
